 E-Commerce project is a full-stack system where the React frontend communicates with a Spring Boot backend using REST APIs. The backend uses JWT authentication to verify users and roles. Products are stored in a MySQL database. Admins have special permissions to modify product data, while normal users can only view and purchase products.
 
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
Backend (API): Spring Boot (Java)
Database: MySQL (using XAMPP)

It allows:

Users to register and log in

Admins to add, edit, or delete products

Normal users to view and buy products

Everything connects through HTTP requests (API calls) between React and Spring Boot.
